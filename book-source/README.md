# Java Source Code (From Book)

This is the Java source code that accompanies the [Streamlined Object Modeling][book]. I'm 
reproducing it here ([original source][source]) because I find that I need to reference it a lot
as I am thinking about how to apply the principles described in the book.

I do not believe that I am violating any licensing by doing so; however, if you feel that 
reproducing the code here is not appropriate, please post an issue on GitHub. Thanks!
