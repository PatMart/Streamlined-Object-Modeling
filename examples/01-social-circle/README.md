# Social Circle And Friends

I really enjoy working with human concepts (since they make sense in my head) and human 
interactions. As such, I thought it would be fun (and complex enough) to try to model the rules 
that surround a group of friends. Each group will be composed of one or more people, including both
men and women. But, the following rules apply:

* No group of friends can be larger than 150 members, according to [Dunbar's number][dunbar].

* Men and women can be in the same group, so long as the ratio of one gender to the other does not
drop lower than 1/4. Meaning, you cannot have a group with 5 men and 1 woman (or vice-versa).

* Men and women cannot be in the same group of friends if they share a mutual attraction towards
one another (you've seen When Harry Met Sally, right?).

* Unrequited attractions are allowed; but, only if they do n0t create a love-triangle. Meaning, 
it's OK for Sarah to have a crush on Bob, only so long as Bob does _not_ have a crush on someone 
else. This would only lead to unnecessary heartache in causal conversation.

* No person in the group can be under the age of 18 (we're all adults here).

* People can belong to more than one social circle (ie, group of friends). 

* No person can have an attraction to themselves (ie, no narcissists here, please).

Anyway, that's just my first pass on the topic. As I start to learn more about this stuff, I'm sure
that I'll add and remove from this list.
